<h1>Learn how to add inputs in Python</h1>

Last page I said I will walk you through how to maket the program interactive and have user inputs. This is very simple and combines variables and a new kind of print statement; the input. 
All you need to do to extend your variable is type:

</p>

<br>
<br>

<pre style="text-align:center">

name=input("What is your name?")

</pre>

<br>
<br>

<p>

Like with print statements you can put whatever you want between the apostrophes and likewise with the variable name. The variable on the other side of the "=" 
is just like every other variable and you can put it in a normal print statement so that people can see what they typed in. Remember, you always have to make an input statement with the variable.

Remember to not put quotation marks in the brakets, otherwise it will display the exact contents within the quotes rather than what is inside the variable. 
You may have been wondering on the last page why I called variables with words "strings", this is because you can STRING them together with normal print statements. Here is an example: 

</p>

<p>

You can also sandwich the variable inbetween 2 peices of text.

<p>

You can also join strings and numbers (within a variable) together to put another number into a print string. However just putting somthing like this won't work.

<p>

This blows up because although you have entered a number, the computer automatically treats it as a word in this configuration so a mathmatical operation,like subtraction, 
is impssible even though you have entered a number. However, if you just print out the value of age,without any mathamatical operations, it would come up as a number. 
So how do we make the computer know it is dealing with a number? Simple you just add the operation int(), which stands for integer.

<p>

However you may have noticed when testing your code that the program does not except non whole numbers, like 2.5,because integer means whole number which means you can't put decimals in.
To make it so that it alows decimals, type float instead of int, as floats can be any number, you can remember this by imagining that the decimal floats between the 2 whole numbers. 
On the nex page I will cover how to branch out the possible outcomes so that the user can get a different result if they enter something different.
