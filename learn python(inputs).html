<h1>Learn how to add inputs in Python</h1>

Last page I said I will walk you through how to maket the program interactive and have user inputs. This is very simple and combines variables and a new kind of print statement; the input. 
All you need to do to extend your variable is type:

</p>

<br>
<br>

<pre style="text-align:center">

name=input("What is your name?")

</pre>

<br>
<br>

<p>

Like with print statements you can put whatever you want between the apostrophes and likewise with the variable name. The variable on the other side of the "=" 
is just like every other variable and you can put it in a normal print statement so that people can see what they typed in. Remember, you always have to make an input statement with the variable.

Remember to not put quotation marks in the brakets, otherwise it will display the exact contents within the quotes rather than what is inside the variable. 
You may have been wondering on the last page why I called variables with words "strings", this is because you can STRING them together with normal print statements. Here is an example:
