<h1>Making text appear in Python</h1>

<p>

If you are familiar with learning programming languages, you would have learnt the univeral starting point: 
making the words "hello world" appear when you run your program. In Python, it is very simple to display such text. All you have to do is type:     

</p>

<pre>
                        
                   

                                                                            print("Hello World)
</pre>

<br>
<br>
<p>

Then if you run your program, it should display those letters.

<p>

If you press run it may say something like Syntax error at the bottom. Don't panic, it just means that you might have spelled or missplaced letters or symbols. 
Programming languages are very particular about how you spell and configure things. 
You can play around with what you put within the commas so you can make it say athor things than Hello World.

</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>

You can also take out the commas so it won't display that exact information, but the result of it. You can tpe in: print(2-2) and the answer will pop up on the screen. 
You can also combine this with variables but I will go over them on the next page.
