Some of you with experience of variables in aathor languages can skip this explination 
but to those of you who have never even heard of what a variable is I will give a definition. 
A variable is a kind of box where you can store information while the programs running, for example the score of a game, 
which can change without you having to go back into the code and manually change the information, hence the term variable. 
In Python, it is very easy to make a variable. All you have to do to set the value or content of a variable is type:

<pre style="text-align:center">

variable=6

</p>

<br>
