<h1>Making variables in Python</h1>

<p>

Some of you with experience of variables in aathor languages can skip this explination 
but to those of you who have never even heard of what a variable is I will give a definition. 
A variable is a kind of box where you can store information while the programs running, for example the score of a game, 
which can change without you having to go back into the code and manually change the information, hence the term variable. 
In Python, it is very easy to make a variable. All you have to do to set the value or content of a variable is type:

</p>

<pre style="text-align:center">

variable=6

</pre>

<br>
<br>

<p>

You don't have to use the word "variable" for this, you can put whatever you want like "score" or "kills".
Play around with this, because managing your variable names can help you out a lot when you have multiple. 
I mentioned that I would connect last pages printing topic to this one and I can show you now. If you want to display the value of the variable you can do this:

</p>

<center>

<img src="images/variable-print.png" width="500px" height="300px">

</center>

<br>
<br>

<p>

Make sure you dont include apostrophes athor wise it would just come upp wth the word score or the chosen name of your variable instead of its contents. 
To show the value of a variable if it's contents are words(technically this would be called a string as it contains words but I will call it a variable for now) you need to put apostrophes in the variable. You can think of this as when the print shows the variable, 
the apostrophes come with it making it just like your average print("Hello") statement.

</p>

<center>

<img src="images/variable-word.png" width="500px" height="300px">

</center>

<br>
<br>

<p>

You can also print something you have added or taken away from the variable or make 2 variables and show their result if you make them interact.

</p>

<img src="images/variable-value.png"  width="500px" height="300px" align="left"> <img src="images/variable-interact.png"  width="500px" height="300px" align="right">

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>

As you can see, you can do many things with variables and in the next page you will learn about combining strings and variables with inputs which, as you can guess, 
is a variable typed in by the person running your code in the results box.
