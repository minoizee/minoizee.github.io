Welcome, on this website I will take you through all the basics and more of python. 
Most of you will probably be familiar with the concept behind progrmming languages and have had many experiences with using them. 
However, a few of you may just be starting your journey in the coding world and don't know what a programming language is yet. Luckily, I will be here to guide you, whatever your experience level.

First thing you need to know is what a programming language is, if you just searched up how to code and luckily, clicked on this website. 
I am sorry to bore you if you already know about different languages and what they are so you can skip to the next page if so. 
A programming language is a sort of language which is writen and then compiled into 0's and 1's which correspond to an on state(1) or off state(0) for a 
physical transistor (if you didn't understand it basically means that this programming language which you right is turned into 
electrical signals which can then light up your computer screen). There are many different types of programming language, just like there are many spoken languages, 
which have different levels of freedom and things you can do on them. These limitations have to be considered when developing software so can choose the right language. 
Python is a very good all-rounder but is very good in data analysis, which will come in handy if you have a career in science where you have massive chunks of data 
you can't process yourself. However HTML, the code I am using to write this website is very different in both it's applications and the code itself. 
You might have guessed that HTML is used for websites as it has fewer limitations in that area.
